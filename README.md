# Lists&Lists

A mobile web app for lists.

This project is an experiment to see how much can be done with a mobile friendly site as a mobile web app. The project makes use of Yeoman, Angular.js, Compass, Bootstrap, and a few other trendy libraries/frameworks.

When checking out this code keep in mind that it's built for my iPhone 4s. Any optimizations beyond that specific device have not been made.

## Setup

When pulling down the repository for development Yeoman must be setup. In terminal navigate to the working copy and run the following command.

```bash
npm install -g yo grunt-cli bower
```

Once that has finished pull down the libraries used with Bower.

```bash
bower install
```
