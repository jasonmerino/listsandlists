Lists&Lists
=============

A mobile web app for lists.

This project is an experiment to see how much I can do with a mobile friendly site as a mobile web app. The project makes use of Yeoman, Angular.js, Compass, Bootstrap, and a few other trendy libraries/frameworks.

When checking out this code keep in mind that it's built for my iPhone 4s. Any optimizations beyond that specific device have not been made.
