# Lists&Lists

A mobile web app for lists.

This project is an experiment to see how much can be done with a mobile friendly site as a mobile web app. The project makes use of Angular.js, Compass, Bootstrap, and a few other trendy libraries/frameworks.

When checking out this code keep in mind that it's built for my iPhone 4s. Any optimizations beyond that specific device have not been made.

## Setup

Open up a terminal and navigate to the directory where you would like to store lists and lists. Then run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jasonmerino/listsandlists.git
cd listsandlists
npm install
bower install
```

After this install is complete go [download MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) and follow the installation instructions per your OS.

To run the application locally run the following command:

```bash
bash start.sh
```
